# Sample-selection-adjusted random forests (SARF)

## Description

A predictive model that is trained with non-randomly selected samples can offer biased predictions for the population. The paper referenced below discusses when non-random selection is a problem. For the applications in which it is a problem, this paper present a procedure for adjusting the predictions of random forest to account for non-random sampling of the training data. This adjustment results in more accurate predictions for the population. Code used in this paper is available here.
